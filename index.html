			</div>
			<div class="stagger-in box">
				<p class="stagger-in">Bitcoin is a digital currency secured by encryption (math). Though, there are no physical ‘coins’, bitcoin is a digital ‘token’ that represent ownership of an asset.</p>
				<p class="stagger-in">Anyone anywhere in the world can trade bitcoin without an intermediary.</p>
				<p class="stagger-in">That means bitcoin doesn't rely on banks, governments, or other institutions to work. Instead, bitcoin is run and managed by the people who own and use it - you and me. It is truly peer-to-peer.</p>
				<p class="stagger-in">This gives bitcoin relative freedom from bureaucracy, over-regulation, and corruption.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="stagger-in box">
				<p class="stagger-in">Only 21m bitcoin have been and will ever be created. That being said, bitcoin can be divided into fractions for trade.</p>
				<p class="stagger-in">No bank or government can print more bitcoin. Instead, bitcoin is "mined" - a process by which anyone in the world can use a computer to try to solve an advanced equation. When a "miner" successfully completes an equation, they are awarded a certain amount of bitcoin.</p>
				<p class="stagger-in">These equations are specifically designed to get harder as more miners enter the market. This helps prevent inflation and keeps the system balanced. It is currently estimated that the last bitcoin will be mined in 2140.</p>
				<p class="stagger-in">Simultaneously, mining verifies and secures bitcoin transactions.</p>

				<h3 class="stagger-in">Why is bitcoin valuable?</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="stagger-in box">
				<p class="stagger-in">Just as we value precious metals and paper currencies, bitcoin is valuable because of its practical usefulness.</p>
				<p class="stagger-in">Before currency, people would trade wool for wheat or sheep for services, etc. Then came coins. With coins, people had a universal note that was guaranteed by middlemen to be valuable for exchange. This method of exchange has worked for millennia. </p>
				<p class="stagger-in">In the age we live, there are more middlemen (merchant processors, banks, etc) wanting to take a larger share of the cut. When you consider the internet, traditional online banking and digital payments expose our personal information to a host of online predators. </p>
				<p class="stagger-in">Bitcoin is the next progression of our monetary system as it provides a universal method of exchanging value while removing the middlemen. It’s also inherently more secure than traditional methods due to its basis on encryption (you’ll learn more about that later). </p>

				<h3 class="stagger-in">Where is bitcoin stored?</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="stagger-in box">
				<p class="stagger-in">Similar to a physical wallet, purse, or online bank account, bitcoin can be stored in various types of ‘wallets’. While most are digital, some can be <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coindesk.com/information/paper-wallet-tutorial/">as primitive as a paper wallet.</a></p>
				<p class="stagger-in">Simply put, a bitcoin wallet is a string of encrypted numbers and letters. You can use this wallet to send and receive bitcoin as easily as you would send an email. </p>
				<p class="stagger-in">Your wallet is how you secure your bitcoin. Many types of wallets have been created, giving each user the flexibility of choosing how they would like to protect their cryptocurrency. </p>
				<p class="stagger-in">Remember, with bitcoin being decentralized, you essentially act as your own bank. What wallet you choose depends on the level of security you prefer.</p>
				<p class="stagger-in">Each wallet contains a public and private key. You can display your public key anywhere you want to be able to receive bitcoin from others. Your private key should be kept, well, private. </p>

				<h3 class="stagger-in">The blockchain</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="stagger-in box">
				<p class="stagger-in">The most important component of bitcoin is the blockchain.</p>
				<p class="stagger-in">The blockchain is a digital ledger that keeps track of every bitcoin transaction.</p>
				<p class="stagger-in">Unlike a bank ledger, the blockchain is public. Every person who participates in bitcoin mining has a current copy of the blockchain.</p>
				<p class="stagger-in">Anytime a transaction takes place, the blockchain is updated to include the new transaction. If several copies of the blockchain don't match up, however, the transaction is blocked. This prevents unauthorized or malicious transactions from taking place.</p>

			<div class="stagger-in box">
				<p class="stagger-in">Just like the internet, cryptocurrencies are disruptive technology that are more effecient than the technologies they replace (think email).</p>
				<p class="stagger-in">Because of this, the proliferation of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain is inevitable.</p>
				<p class="stagger-in">While there are several digital currencies currently utilizing these technologies, only bitcoin has stood the test of time.</p>
